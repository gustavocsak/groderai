Program Requirement

No Syntax Errors
No Runtime Errors
Program must contains at least 5 methods
The program cannot take too long to run or run infinite loop at some points


Correctness of the program
Prompt the user for input and output file names
Create the output to save the sorted words. DO NOT overwrite the original input file.
Change all words to lower case
You have to count number of matching words before you declare the size of the array
If words have a punctuation symbol at the beginning or at the end of the words then remove the punctuation marks from both sides of the word, keep the word.
If words still have any symbol except '-' and letter, then ignore the word
Ignore the words that contain digits
Remove spaces from both sides of the words


Save the words in a file
Sort the words in alphabetical order
Save only one instance of each word, if there are many occurrences of the same word
The input file (unsorted.txt) is used to test your program. If the output misses/contains too many/few words, it will be considered as bugs.
You are not allowed to use Java sort methods
Do not overwrite the original input file
The program should create an output file if the output does not exist.


Print number of the words, and frequency of each letter ('a' to 'z'), ignore cases

Other:

DO NOT use ArrayList because students in 1150 never have an chance to learn it. It is NOT fair that you used ArrayList

DO NOT declare a string array with fixed number of elements. You have to count number of matching words before you declare the size of the array

Take too much time to run the program


header information at the top of the program [include your name, class section and program description]

Use Javadoc comment style and comment your class
- describe the parameter(s) required for each method
- describe the return value (or output) for each method
- describe the purpose of the program
- Comment should be placed on the top of the method


indentation & alignment

Do not use any magic numbers and please use variables for any calculations.
