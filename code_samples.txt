Sample.java:
- Documentation using javadoc
- Linear solution for containsDuplicateSorted
- Does not use Character class
- Correct programming style (variable, class, constant naming, indentation)
- Does not use magic numbers for lowercase conversion
- Linear solution for isEqual


sample2.java:
- Missing class documentation and some methods documentation
- Incorrect format for method documentation, does not use javadoc
- Does use the Character class (not allowed)
- Variable/constant/class naming does not follow programming style
    - Incorrect constant naming (lowercase) (letters instead of LETTERS)
    - Incorrect variable naming (first letter uppercase) (LeftFrequency instead of leftFrequency)
    - Incorrect class naming (first letter lowercase) (sample2 instead of Sample2)
- Uses "magic numbers" to convert to lowercase (Using 32 instead of 'a' - 'A')
- Quadratic solution for containsDuplicateSorted (Solution should be linear)
